# figleaf-torch-nn

Implementation of a Torch-based neural network based on the paper here:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00408 This tool was originally designed to identify
faces even when images have been blurred/mosaic'd, and is included here as an
adversary to evaluate the resilliance of the image encryption schemes against a
sophisticated adversary.

Now that many years have passed the code in this folder will probably require a
bit of work to get running again. It is included only because it might be an
interesting reference, not because it is likely to be directly useful.
